Coding problem solver.

How To contribute
==================
Each java class under org/maj/sm package solves one problem. The class file
contains the description of the problem followed by its solution. There are
test cases to make sure solutions are working as expected.

Each subpackage under org/maj/sm package solves bigger problems where there will
be one "problem.md" file that describes the problem.
